# Claude AI Assistant Instructions

## Code Generation Policy

**CRITICAL: DO NOT GENERATE ANY CODE**

The user has explicitly requested that no code should be generated under any circumstances.

### What This Means:
- Do NOT write new functions, classes, or methods
- Do NOT create new source code files
- Do NOT generate code snippets or examples
- Do NOT write implementation code of any kind

### What You CAN Do:
- Read and analyze existing code
- Answer questions about the codebase
- Search for patterns and functionality
- Run tests and commands
- Review code
- Provide explanations and documentation
- Edit documentation files (like this one)

### If the User Requests Code:
Politely decline and remind them of this standing instruction. If they genuinely want to change this policy, they should explicitly update this file.
