# Walbash DB

An attmept to write my own database.  Something to pass time while unemployed.  This isn't meant to compete with anything in the market.  Just gives me a good excuse to learn the Zig programming language. Basing it off of a book called "Build Your Own Database From Scratch".  I do plan to add some bells and whistles once I get to the point where I kind of have a working prototype. Plan to see this through to completion even if I am able to find a job.

This name is just a placeholder.  Honestly its a play on Wabash, the neigborhood I grew up in located in Kanas City, Missouri. Locally we pronounced it like "Walbash".  And it can also mean WAL (write ahead log) and bash (bourne again shell).  This will have a write-ahead log, can't promise any bash action in this program
