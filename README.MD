# Walbash DB

An attmept to write my own database.  Something to pass time while unemployed.  This isn't meant to compete with anything in the market.  Just gives me a good excuse to learn the Zig programming language. Basing it off of a book called "Build Your Own Database From Scratch".  I do plan to add some bells and whistles once I get to the point where I kind of have a working prototype. Plan to see this through to completion even if I am able to find a job.
