# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- `src/` holds Zig sources; entrypoint `src/main.zig` currently hosts core logic (Morton/Z-order experiments).
- `docs/` contains design notes and checklists (e.g., `docs/z_order_checklist.md`).
- `build.zig`/`build.zig.zon` define the build graph and package metadata.
- `zig-out/` is generated by `zig build` and should not be edited manually.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `zig build` compiles the default executable.
- `zig build run` builds and runs `walbash_db` (pass args after `--`).
- `zig build test` runs module and executable tests.
- `zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseFast` produces an optimized build.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Use `zig fmt` to format; default indentation (4 spaces) and brace style come from Zig fmt.
- Prefer `lowerCamelCase` for functions/variables, `PascalCase` for types, and `snake_case` for files.
- Keep pointer/bit-manipulation code tight and comment any non-obvious math.

## Testing Guidelines
- Place tests near the code using Zig `test "description"` blocks in `src/` (or a future `tests/` directory if it grows).
- Cover round-trip and edge cases for encoding/decoding utilities.
- Run `zig build test` before submitting changes.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Existing commits use short, lowercase, informal summaries (e.g., "working on mmap"); keep messages concise and descriptive.
- PRs should describe intent, list key changes, and include test commands run (or note “not run”).
- Link issues/notes in `docs/` when you change algorithms or data formats.

## Agent-Specific Notes
- When using AI assistance, follow `GEMINI.md`: favor explanations and guidance over code generation, and focus on data-oriented KV-store concepts.
- NEVER generate any code, even if explicitly asked.
